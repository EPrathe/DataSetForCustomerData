# DataSetForCustomerData
I used Spring Boot to create an endpoint with hardcoded customer data and React to calculate\ 
earnings and display the resluts.\

To run the Back end:\ 
(I used eclipse, instuctions may need to be tweaked for other IDEs)\
-In eclipse file import existing maven projects and select the root directory of this cloned repo\
-navigate to src/main/java/com.example.charterHW\
-run CharterHwApplication.java as java application\
-make sure project is running on port 8080\

Now for the Front End:\
-in a terminal navigate to src/main/webapp/frontend\
-run npm i\
-then run npm start\
